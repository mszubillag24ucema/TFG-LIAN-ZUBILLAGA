No último dia da minha estadia, percebi que entraram em meu quarto sem minha permissão, mesmo com o aviso de ""não perturbe"" na porta. Cheguei ao hotel depois de um dia exaustivo de trabalho, entrei em meu quarto e percebi que os itens do frigobar haviam sido removidos. Questionei à recepção se alguém havia entrado e eles não sabiam, pediram tempo para revisar as câmeras (precisavam acesso que só seria concedido no dia seguinte) e enviaram alguém da equipe para fazer algumas perguntas. Me orientaram a ficar tranquilo e descansar, pois eles estariam vigiando meu quarto, mas obviamente fiquei preocupado com a possibilidade de que alguém estranho tivesse acesso e pudesse entrar de surpresa. Fiquei com medo e ansioso, não consegui dormir e não pude descansar antes de sair para pegar meu voo. Ao fazer o check-out, o responsável pela segurança veio conversar comigo e dizer que haviam identificado que realmente um funcionário do hotel entrou em meu quarto para remover as bebidas do frigobar, de maneira equivocada (deveria fazer isso na outra torre, não na em que eu estava). De qualquer maneira, achei péssima a experiência, pois me senti exposto e inseguro.

I asked the front desk if anyone had entered and they didn&#39;t know. They asked for time to check the cameras (they needed access that would only be granted the next day) and sent someone from the staff to ask me a few questions. They told me to stay calm and rest, as they would be watching my room, but I was obviously worried about the possibility that someone strange had access and could enter by surprise. I was scared and anxious, I couldn&#39;t sleep and I couldn&#39;t rest before leaving to catch my flight. When I checked out, the security officer came to talk to me and said that they had discovered that a hotel employee had actually entered my room to remove drinks from the minibar, in the wrong way (he should have done this in the other tower, not the one I was in).

2024-04-03 16:53:32.000,LUCAS,Member,5.0,"Hola! Quiero aclarar que el hotel está bien, pero no ayuda a tener una buena experiencia. Si bien lo que no me gustó son detalles, creo que son demasiados para un hotel de esta categoría. En otro tipo de hotel ni lo hubiera considerado, pero en esta ocasión fui buscando una buena experiencia.
En primer lugar, al momento de querer usar el sauna tuve el problema de que no podía encontrar una ducha libre entre las entradas al sauna (es decir, las duchas frías para cortar el calor). Si bien el vestuario es grande, y tiene una capacidad de lockers de 20, sólo hay 2 duchas. En los días es que estuve hubo muy poca gente, y el sauna siempre estuvo vacío. Incluso en la pileta no había demasiada gente. Por eso era llamativo que, en el transcurso de una hora no hubiera una ducha disponible. Imagino que en días donde la asistencia sea mayor esto debe ser un problema. Y, hablando de una actividad que debería sea relajante, puede estropear toda la experiencia.
Otro punto que me llamó la atención fue la oferta de té. Tanto en room service como en el bar decía ""Selección de tés"". Sin embargo, la elección era de lo más normal. Creo que un hotel como este debería poder ofrecer, además de lo normal, algo superior (siempre pensando en mejorar la experiencia). Podría decir lo mismo del café, pero entiendo que para esto se necesitaría un barista y puede ser que no tengan esta demanda, pero el té es más simple.
Otro punto que quería traer era la falta de batas en la habitación y en la zona de la pileta. Si bien se resuelve pidiéndolas, creo que se podría agregar al servicio de la habitación (cuando pregunté me dijeron que siempre se piden).
Como dije antes, estas cosas son pequeñas, pero creo que detalles como estos hacen la diferencia entre un hotel y otro.
Ediliciamente el hotel está muy bien, y la atención personal es correcta. Pero en esta categoría son cosas esperables.
Quiero aclarar que esta crítica está hecha con la mejor voluntad. No hay en ella ningún ánimo de ofender a nadie.",10.0,10.0,9.0,10.0,5.0,Todos los puntos están cubiertos en mi primer texto,10.0,Couple,2.5,Excelente,361,4,2024,2024-04,Otoño,8.5,es,"Hello! I want to clarify that the hotel is fine, but it doesn&#39;t help to have a good experience. Although I didn&#39;t like the details, I think they are too many for a hotel of this category. In another type of hotel I wouldn&#39;t have even considered it, but on this occasion I was looking for a good experience. First of all, when I wanted to use the sauna I had the problem that I couldn&#39;t find a free shower between the entrances to the sauna (i.e. the cold showers to cut the heat). Although the locker room is large, and has a capacity of 20 lockers, there are only 2 showers. On the days I was there there were very few people, and the sauna was always empty. Even in the pool there weren&#39;t too many people. That&#39;s why it was striking that, for the course of an hour there was not a shower available. I imagine that on days where attendance is higher this must be a problem. And, speaking of an activity that should be relaxing, it can spoil the whole experience. Another point that caught my attention was the tea offer. Both in room service and in the bar it said &quot;Selection of teas&quot;. However, the choice was the most normal. I think that a hotel like this should be able to offer, in addition to the normal, something superior (always thinking about improving the experience). I could say the same about the coffee, but I understand that for this a barista would be needed and they may not have this demand, but tea is simpler. Another point I wanted to bring up was the lack of bathrobes in the room and in the pool area. Although it is solved by asking for them, I think that it could be added to the room service (when I asked, they told me that they are always asked for). As I said before, these things are small, but I think that details like these make the difference between one hotel and another. Building-wise, the hotel is very good, and the personal attention is correct. But in this category, these are things to be expected. I want to clarify that this criticism is made with the best will.

Mi reciente estancia en el   fue una experiencia gratificante en muchos aspectos, principalmente gracias al excepcional servicio proporcionado por su personal. Desde el momento en que llegamos, nos recibieron con una cálida bienvenida y nos brindaron asistencia en todas nuestras necesidades.

El personal del   demostró un compromiso excepcional con la satisfacción del cliente. Siempre estaban dispuestos a resolver cualquier situación que surgiera durante nuestra estadía. Desde preguntas sobre las comodidades del hotel hasta solicitudes especiales, el equipo estuvo disponible y dispuesto a ayudar en todo momento.

Sin embargo, hubo algunas áreas en las que notamos algunas deficiencias. Por ejemplo, el jacuzzi en los baños no funcionaba durante nuestra estancia, lo cual fue decepcionante ya que esperábamos disfrutar de esa comodidad. Además, nos vimos obligados a cambiarnos de habitación debido a la insuficiente iluminación en el baño de nuestra habitación inicial. Aunque el personal manejó la situación de manera eficiente y nos ayudó a cambiar de habitación sin problemas, este inconveniente inicial fue un contratiempo.

Además, observamos un pequeño inconveniente en cuanto a la cantidad de toallas proporcionadas en las habitaciones. En una habitación para cuatro personas, notamos que si se dejaban solo dos toallas en el baño, automáticamente generaba una llamada a recepción.

From the moment we arrived, we were greeted with a warm welcome and assisted with all of our needs. The staff at the demonstrated an exceptional commitment to customer satisfaction. They were always willing to resolve any situation that arose during our stay. From questions about hotel amenities to special requests, the team was available and willing to help at all times. However, there were a few areas where we noticed some shortcomings. For example, the jacuzzi in the bathrooms was not working during our stay, which was disappointing as we were hoping to enjoy that convenience. Additionally, we were forced to change rooms due to insufficient lighting in the bathroom of our initial room. Although the staff handled the situation efficiently and helped us change rooms without any issues, this initial inconvenience was a setback. Additionally, we noted a minor inconvenience regarding the number of towels provided in the rooms. In a room for four people, we noticed that if just two towels were left in the bathroom, it automatically triggered a call to the front desk. While we appreciate the attention to detail, this policy could be revised to provide an even smoother experience for guests. Despite these minor hiccups, the staff at the always responded professionally and efficiently to our concerns, which mitigated any inconveniences that may have arisen. Overall, my experience at the was a positive one, thanks in large part to the exceptional service provided by its dedicated staff.",positive,0.20000000298023224,9.800000190734863,positive

A comment regarding the portion sizes. A normal club sandwich is 3 slices of bread with the fillings. The fact that 2 full sandwiches (6 slices of bread) and fries was the serving here is extremely wasteful as we can’t imagine many people would be able to consume that amount of food. We gave the extra sandwich to a homeless person with a child.  There were a lot of staff in the restaurant doing nothing but only one bartender in Ruby Bar who found it difficult to keep up with bar and table service.

But there is a glaring weakness: some of the staff just aren't very friendly.  For example, the entrance doors are *very* sticky and hard to open.  Nobody opened the door, greeted me, or helped with luggage.  I usually travel with a digital piano and this would have been a real struggle just to get into the hotel.  Once inside, I noticed a group of bellboys / concierge staff just standing well back from the front doors talking amongst themselves.

And it wasn't just when I arrived. Every time I came and went from the hotel, they'd be standing around, apparently doing nothing. They never helped, or said hello, or anything - just indifferent stares.  Very weird and not welcoming.

I contrast this with  s across Asia where the bellboys and concierge staff greet you at the door, help you with luggage, just say hello and ask if there is anything you need.

At breakfast, there may (or may not) have been a to-order omlet or egg station. Nobody told me but I saw other patrons with omelets. Some mornings it was hard to find a table because tables hadn't been cleared in a timely manner.

If there was one thing that could be done to improve the hotel, it would simply be to increase the attentiveness of the staff.  It doesn't have to be anything major, they should just be looking for things to do, ask if people need assistance, etc.  And this should be applicable to guests who are non-native Spanish speakers, too.",10.0,Meeting,5.0,Excelente,133,12,2023,2023-12,Verano,8.25,en,"I had great stay at the Buenos Aires  .

Long story short, 3 trips back and forth to the front desk for new keys they finally sent maintenance who spent 45 minutes with a hallway of   employees and then said the battery was dead on my door and they would need to come back in an hour. I needed to shower, work and rest before my evening plans (tango lessons then tango dinner) so I asked them to change my room. While they worked on my door lock, there was 5   employees in my room and in the hall, I work in the legal field so I was unable to make the confidential phone calls needed for work in California. When I first asked for a manager at the beginning of this fiasco, I was told there wasn't one available and that there physically wasn't one at the hotel (?!?!).. only when my tour manager called and complained to them did they have a manager show up. He offered me lounge access for my trouble (I've now lost 3+ hours of work time).. I told him you can keep your lounge access, I need to work in the room. He apologized and admitted that ""there were two managers behind this wall and the GM is upstairs and none of them like to deal with customers"" so they did not respond when requested!!!!!

Are you kidding me? Another Gate One client Nishta was standing with me, glad I had a witness to this unbelievable statement by the Manager of Public Relations for   Buenos Aires hotel.

They finally give me a new room at my request, I move everything and spend the night in a sweat thinking I must be coming down with a fever. In the morning, I realize the AC doesn't work! I call the manager, who sends someone who confirms yes, it's broken.

I pack up and move rooms again, to my third room in the  . Settle in, unpack, begin working and then attempt to flush the toilet, which doesn't flush. I called and they sent someone to fix it.

I am in shock about this hotel and what garbage it is, and for a manager to tell me that the other managers don't want to deal with me so I wasted 3 hours dealing with being locked out of my room without management assistance- unbelievable.

I should mention, each time I moved rooms I was downgraded- the OPPOSITE of what should have happened!!!
I went from a room with a small view of the street, to a view of ac units outside with the USB plugs not working, to a tiny room with an uglier view. I have told my local friends who were going to come stay at the hotel not to spend a penny to stay here.

Here are photos from the three rooms as they went downhill quickly.

first room, which I was locked out of it and they couldn't fit the lock within the 3 hours:

Please let me know what   will do to make this up to me, this is unacceptable. I have traveled with Gate 1 many times over the years and have never experienced anything like this. In fact, in the 49 yrs of my life, traveling the world, I've never had a hotel manager tell me their other managers refused to deal with me because they don't like dealing with customers.

All and all an amazing stay.

My one piece of constructive feedback… on the night of November 8th, my friends and I were waiting in the lobby for the van to take us to La Ventana for the tango show (magnificent recommendation by Florencia). The security team member patrolling the lobby saw me sitting on the desk (not the couch) on the left side as you enter the lobby area from the street… came up to me… pointed and waved his walkie talkie at me… as if to say… “get off”. He didn’t come up and nicely ask me to move… if he had I would have explained that soft couches hurt my back and I had just walked 10 miles that day… but the pointing really bothered me. Just a little coaching…. It’s better to walk up and provide an explanation then to point like that.

2023-09-23 21:06:05.000,FABIANO,Non-Member,7.0,"O hotel é bem localizado, mas falta em qualidade para se intitular 5 estrelas. O café da manhã é pouco variado, repetitivo, sem tortas doces e sem reposição a medida que vai chegando a hora do término. Portanto os hóspedes que vão tomar café 1h antes do término já não podem desfrutar de todos os itens que o hotel dispõe em seu café da manhã.  Além disso colocam os talheres direto sobre jogos americanos,  ao invés de disporem sobre guardanapos de tecido.  Um hotel 5 estrelas deveria abolir jogos americanos que não conseguem ser adequadamente limpos de um hospede para o outro e usar apenas toalhas e guardanapos limpos entre um hóspede e outro.
Outro ponto negativo para um hotel 5 estrelas foi o fato do hotel nao restringir pessoas em traje de banho durante o cafe da manhã.

Therefore, guests who go to breakfast 1 hour before it ends cannot enjoy all the items the hotel has for breakfast. Furthermore, they place the cutlery directly on placemats, instead of on cloth napkins. A 5-star hotel should do away with placemats that cannot be properly cleaned between guests and only use clean towels and napkins between guests. Another negative point for a 5-star hotel was the fact that the hotel did not restrict people in bathing suits during breakfast.

2023-07-24 15:29:30.000,MARIA,Member,3.0,"Buenas tardes, gracias por contactarme y querer saber mi opinión.
La realidad es que fui con muchas expectativas y mucho entusiasmo pero volví bastante decepcionada. 
Llegue 15:45 hs aprox y me dicen que la habitación no estaba disponible. Consulto si el check in era 15 hs ya que creí que me había confundido y que había llegado antes, la persona que me atiende me indica que efectivamente es a las 15 hs pero que como contaban con mucha demanda todavía no estaba lista. Acepto ya que podía suceder. Me pide DNI de las personas que nos íbamos a hospedar, en este caso yo y mi hijo de 9 años. Me indica que debe tomar copias de nuestros DNI y quedárselas. Se los lleva y demora bastante en volver. Decido alejarme de la recepción y sentarme a esperar. Cuando regresa me dice que no puede cobrarme ni tomar la habitación ya que el sistema no se lo permitía. Acepto y le digo que espero. Luego de unos minutos sin explicarme nada me pide una tarjeta de crédito como garantía (lo normal de cualquier hotel) pero no me indica el valor por el que va a hacer la pre-autorización, ni me lo muestra, ni me dice que luego lo anularían ni nada, solo pasa la tarjeta y se queda con él voucher. Le explico que no prefería pagar mi estadía con esa tarjeta sino que voy a realizar el pago en efectivo. En ese momento queda disponible la habitación y puede tomarla. No me indica el tipo de cambio, solo me dice que son $90465.-, le doy $90500.- y me dice que no cuenta con cambio para darme el vuelto. Le digo que no hay problema, asumo que es un importe menor. Me dice que no me puede dar la factura, que me la va a enviar a la habitación, le digo que no hay problema sin embargo la factura jamás me llego. 
Me voy a la habitación, la asignada fue la Nro 1230, un tanto decepcionada por la mala impresión inicial.
Al día siguiente me retiro, la chica que me atiende no me presta demasiada atención. Le pido la factura indicándole que no me la habían dado ni enviado a la habitación. Me la pone en un sobre, me la entrega y se dirige a atender a otra persona. 
El día viernes 21 me contacta el banco emisor de mi tarjeta diciéndome que tenían pendiente un cobro de $120.000.- del día 18/07, les explico que seguramente había sido un bloqueo por parte del hotel y me indican que se encuentra pendiente de cobro que por favor me contacté con el hotel y revoquen ese voucher para que no se efectúe el cobro. La persona que me atiende por teléfono me dice que efectivamente fue una preutorizacion y no un cobro que ma va a enviar por mail la anulación de ese voucher y la factura que yo había abonado en efectivo. Recibí al mail el voucher que indicaba pre autorizacion. No estaba la factura que yo había abonado pero de todos modos yo la tenía física en papel.
Esperaba mucho más del hotel en cuanto a la atención, las instalaciones muy prolijas, todo muy limpio y ordenado, confortable y agradables los ambientes. 
Agradezco la cordialidad de tomarse su tiempo para leer mi experiencia.

The truth is that I went with high expectations and enthusiasm but I came back quite disappointed. I arrived at approximately 3:45 p.m. and they told me that the room was not available. I asked if check-in was at 3 p.m. since I thought I had made a mistake and that I had arrived earlier. The person who helped me told me that it was indeed at 3 p.m. but that since they were expecting a lot of demand, it was not ready yet. I accepted since it could happen. He asked me for the ID of the people who were going to stay, in this case me and my 9-year-old son. He told me that he should take copies of our IDs and keep them. He takes them and takes a long time to return. I decide to leave the reception and sit down to wait. When he returns he tells me that he cannot charge me or take the room since the system did not allow it. I accepted and told him that I would wait. After a few minutes without explaining anything, he asks me for a credit card as a guarantee (normal for any hotel) but he doesn&#39;t tell me the amount for which he is going to make the pre-authorization, nor does he show it to me, nor does he tell me that they would cancel it later or anything, he just swipes the card and keeps the voucher. I explain to him that I did not prefer to pay for my stay with that card but that I am going to make the payment in cash. At that moment the room becomes available and he can take it. He doesn&#39;t tell me the exchange rate, he only tells me that it is $90,465.-, I give him $90,500.- and he tells me that he doesn&#39;t have change to give me the change. I tell him that there is no problem, I assume that it is a smaller amount. He tells me that he cannot give me the invoice, that he will send it to the room, I tell him that there is no problem, however the invoice never arrived. I go to the room, the one assigned was number 1230, somewhat disappointed by the initial bad impression. The next day I checked out, and the girl who helped me didn&#39;t pay much attention to me. I asked for the invoice, telling her that it hadn&#39;t been given to me or sent to my room. She put it in an envelope, gave it to me, and went to help someone else. On Friday the 21st, the bank that issued my card contacted me telling me that they had a pending charge of $120,000.- from 07/18. I explained to them that it had probably been blocked by the hotel and they told me that it was pending collection and that I should please contact the hotel and revoke that voucher so that the charge wouldn&#39;t be made. The person who helped me on the phone told me that it was indeed a pre-authorization and not a charge and that she was going to send me by email the cancellation of that voucher and the invoice that I had paid in cash. I received the voucher that indicated pre-authorization by email. The invoice that I had paid wasn&#39;t there, but I had it in physical form on paper anyway. I expected much more from the hotel in terms of service, the facilities were very neat, everything was very clean and tidy, comfortable and the rooms were pleasant. I appreciate the kindness of taking the time to read my experience. Greetings.",neutral,-0.20000000298023224,15.699999809265137,negative

Pero para que sigan subiendo en los ratings, si, debo mencionar algunas situaciones que podrían estar mejor manejadas:

1) A la hora de cenar quisimos ir al Celtic Bar. Preguntamos en la recepción donde quedaba. Nos indicaron. Fuimos hasta allí y se encontraba vacío y con unas sogas en la entrada. Volvimos a la recepción y les contamos lo que encontramos y recién ahí averiguaron y se enteraron que estaba cerrado. No deberían saber de antemano que restaurantes o bares se encuentran abiertos y funcionado??

2) Cenamos en La Luciérnaga. Allí tuvimos 2 inconvenientes. 
El primero, luego de ingresar al restaurante nos sentamos en una mesa. A la cual nos trajeron el menú, luego nos acercaron una silla extra para que colocáramos la cartera. Una vez que vino el mozo y ordenamos la cena el propio mozo nos pidió que por favor nos cambiáramos de mesa ya que el se encontraba atendiendo en las mesas que se encontraban 3 filas más atrás!! Eso me pareció muy mal. Tener que levantarnos y cambiar de mesa luego de ordenar??? Esa situación fue la primera vez para mi- y muy incómoda.
El segundo inconveniente surgió cuando mi marido pidió el ojo de bife estilo argentino en su punto jugoso. El bife lamentablemente lo trajeron cocido la primera vez y aún más cocido la segunda vez. A raíz de todo esto, mi marido debió pedirse un plato de pasta (que según el estuvo delicioso) pero la experiencia de cena fue tremendamente mala ya que mientras yo comía mi plato principal mi marido me tuvo que mirar (sin tener el su plato para cenar) y mientras el ceno yo lo mire comer ya que yo ya había terminado con mi plato.

We loved the room and the best thing by far was the spa on the 23rd floor and its beautiful views! But to keep them going up in the ratings, yes, I must mention some situations that could be better handled: 1) At dinner time we wanted to go to the Celtic Bar. We asked at the reception where it was. They told us. We went there and it was empty and had ropes at the entrance. We went back to the reception and told them what we found and only then did they find out and find out that it was closed. Shouldn&#39;t they know in advance which restaurants or bars are open and functioning?? 2) We had dinner at La Luciérnaga. There we had 2 problems. The first, after entering the restaurant we sat at a table. They brought us the menu, then they brought us an extra chair so we could put our purse on it. Once the waiter came and we ordered dinner, the waiter himself asked us to please change tables since he was serving the tables that were 3 rows behind us!! I thought that was very bad. Having to get up and change tables after ordering??? That situation was a first for me - and very uncomfortable. The second inconvenience arose when my husband ordered the Argentinean-style rib eye, cooked to perfection. Unfortunately, the steak was cooked the first time and even more cooked the second time. As a result of all this, my husband had to order a pasta dish (which according to him was delicious) but the dinner experience was tremendously bad since while I was eating my main dish, my husband had to watch me (without having his dinner plate) and while he was eating dinner, I watched him eat since I had already finished my plate.

Sólo una observación. Bajando a desayunar uno de los días me quedé encerrado en el ascensor, el cual me llevó a los saltos hasta el subsuelo (experiencia muy desagradable) y luego no me dejó salir. Solicité asistencia al intercomunicador y luego de un rato y alguna maniobra de  mantenimiento (supongo, ya que nadie se comunicó conmigo) el ascensor subió sólo hasta el piso 18 donde se abrieron las puertas, salí y bajé por la escalera de emergencia. Informé el hecho en recepción. Más allá del hecho que el ascensor puede tener un desperfecto entendible como cualquier máquina pasible de fallas, hubiera esperado algo de preocupación por saber si estaba bien, sin contar el perjuicio del tiempo que perdí en este incidente.

Going down to breakfast one day I got stuck in the elevator, which took me jumping down to the basement (very unpleasant experience) and then it wouldn&#39;t let me out. I asked for assistance on the intercom and after a while and some maintenance work (I suppose, since no one contacted me) the elevator only went up to the 18th floor where the doors opened, I got out and went down the emergency stairs. I reported the incident at reception. Beyond the fact that the elevator may have an understandable defect like any machine that is susceptible to failure, I would have expected some concern to know if it was okay, not to mention the loss of time I lost in this incident.

La estadía fue placentera pero tenemos algunas cuestiones
El sábado al arribar nos otorgan una habitación en el piso 7 que luego de desempacar y utilizar las instalaciones nos comunican que debemos cambiar, nos otorgan una mejor habitación y agradecemos la atención.
El domingo cuando nos dirigimos a desayunar nos encontramos que el desayuno no está incluído..... Nunca en la reserva que la realizó desde su página indica que no tenemos el servicio incluido... Lo cual procedemos abonar... Casi más caro que el costo de la habitación 😕.

Llegué temprano al hotel y mi habitación estaba lista, pero me comentaron que no podía entrar hasta las 14.00/15.00. 
Teniendo en cuenta que la habitación ya estaba lista y preparada, realmente no entendía por qué no podía pasar puesto que no suponía ningún esfuerzo adicional para el hotel. Soy miembro del club. 
En cualquier caso la persona que me atendió en recepción, a pesar de la sugerencia del pago consiguió que pudiese entrar sin gastos, lo cual agradecí muchísimo. Llegaba de un viaje largo y tenía una reunión importante y necesitaba por lo menos, descansar y prepararme para dicha reunión. La entrada a la habitación fueron unas 3 horas antes aprox de lo que hubiese sido la entrada habitual del check in. 

Con esto quiero decir, que es importante este tipo de servicio a los que optamos por alojarnos en   y quizás este tipo de detalles marcan la diferencia de elegir un hotel u otro. 

Estuve muy agradecida a la persona de recepción que me atendió. 
Por otro lado, quiero hacer una mención especial a Carlos que es la persona que está en la puerta (sr de pelo blanco con ojos claros) que ayuda con las maletas. 
Un sr educado, de buen humor siempre y dispuesto a ayudar. La vez anterior que estuve en su hotel, él mismo me atendió y le recordaba nítidamente. 

La actitud de esta persona: amigable, educado y sonriente también marca la diferencia en los hoteles. Al final el trato humano es necesario e imprescindible. 

Por último comentar que no soy una persona muy especialita con las habitaciones, pero sugiero que informen al personal de limpieza que los que están alojados en habitaciones pegadas al cuarto desde donde salen los carritos, tengan más cuidado con los ruidos. Estaba en la habitación 1826 y todos los días sobre las 6.30 a.m. se oían golpes de sacar el carro. Cada día era mi despertador. :(

Muchas gracias por permitirme la posibilidad de compartir mi experiencia en  . 

Sin duda, volveré a este hotel. 
Gracias y que tengan buen día. 
Sara Navarrete Trokenheim",10.0,9.0,10.0,7.0,8.0,"Como indicado en mi primer comentario, al principio fue un poco complicado, pero finalmente se solucionó el inconveniente. 
Es cierto que las habitaciones (por lo menos la que yo tenía) estaba bastante antigua. Quizás una reforma de las habitaciones (si son todas como la que yo estaba) estaría bastante bien. Sobre todo por el concepto que tenemos de   hoteles.",10.0,Meeting,5.0,Excelente,346,5,2023,2023-05,Otoño,8.5,es,"Good morning. I arrived early at the hotel and my room was ready, but I was told that I could not check in until 2:00/3:00 p.m. Considering that the room was already ready and prepared, I really did not understand why I could not go in since it did not involve any additional effort for the hotel. I am a member of the club. In any case, the person who attended to me at reception, despite the suggestion of payment, managed to let me in without charge, which I greatly appreciated. I had arrived from a long trip and had an important meeting and needed at least to rest and prepare for said meeting. The entrance to the room was approximately 3 hours earlier than the usual check-in time. With this I mean that this type of service is important for those of us who choose to stay at and perhaps this type of detail makes the difference between choosing one hotel or another. I was very grateful to the person at reception who attended to me. On the other hand, I would like to make a special mention of Carlos, who is the person at the door (a white-haired gentleman with light eyes) who helps with the suitcases. He is a polite gentleman, always in a good mood and willing to help. The last time I was at his hotel, he himself attended to me and I clearly reminded him. The attitude of this person: friendly, polite and smiling also makes the difference in hotels. In the end, human treatment is necessary and essential. Finally, I would like to say that I am not a very particular person with rooms, but I suggest that they inform the cleaning staff that those who are staying in rooms next to the room from which the carts come out, should be more careful with noise. I was in room 1826 and every day at about 6.30 am you could hear the banging of the cart being taken out. Every day it was my alarm clock. :( Thank you very much for allowing me the opportunity to share my experience on . I will definitely return to this hotel. Thank you and have a nice day.

I called maintenance to come fix it but they were not able too. Not that big of a deal, but I did it would have been fun to have the candle light/spa bath that night in our room.

Expedia explained, and i went thru high level management, that. you already had the money and needed to give approval for refund. that is just BAD business and I plan to never stay at a   again due to this lack of customer service.

We have been looking forward to stay at this property but have been disappointed by the hotel on many occasions. Below you will find a list of objective items. Overall, a nice hotel, our room was very nice and most staff friendly. 

Check-in experience 
During check-in (first reservation from 24th to 26th of February), I was not specifically welcomed as a rewards member. I was also not informed during check-in that our rate includes a dinner at the hotel’s restaurant. Usually, hotels provide a welcome letter with all relevant details and benefits. However, we have been told that our room will be ready by around 12 am and that they will inform us using the   app chat functionality. My attempt to contact them by the chat functionality also did not result in a status update. Around 3:30 pm we went back to the reception to inquire the status of our room, which was ready by then. 

Items included in the rate not delivered 
Our second reservation for an upper suite from 26th to 27th of February also included a dinner and bottle of champagne (according to rate details). We did not receive a bottle of champagne. In addition, the pictures presented on the hotel website suggest that we would have flowers, some pastry and a wide choice of Nescafé in our room. This was not the case. 

Dinner arrangements 
I noticed myself on the 25th late evening when I rechecked the reservation for details on the price that a dinner was included. I asked at the Restaurant around 10 pm if it was possible to have a single dinner for three (including my wife’s sister)  on the 26th instead of two single dinners (for the first dinner it was too late anyway on the 25th). My request was rejected. The next day I asked at the reception if they could arrange for an exception. They told me to check with the manger and to get back to me. I also informed them that they never informed me about the dinner option included in the rate. They never informed us about any result and we hat to take dinner outside the hotel together with my sister in law. 

Forgotten Taxi reservation 
On the 26th we asked the front desk around 9 pm to make a reservation for a taxi to the airport next day at 10am. We have been waiting outside for a taxi that never arrived because the front desk forgot to reserve a taxi for us. I had to call a taxi myself and assist the taxi driver to put my luggage into the car. There was no attention by the hotel staff. 

In addition, we noticed the following:
Our bathroom light was flickering, they fixed it upon my request 
The pool was not meeting my expectations (I know the pool from before corona). Inside the water I saw a significant number of small particles floating. Some of the tiles were so dirty that people already wrote limpiame (clean me) on them. We only went once to the pool. I would have liked to spend more time at the pool, but given the water condition I rather avoided it. 
The breakfast is better in other hotels, at the  : poor quality, coffee comes only from a machine (where is the barista), fried eggs, Omelettes etc. have not been offered, the medialunas (Argentinian croissants) are much better in any random bakery outside the hotel. Consequently, we went only once for breakfast inside the hotel.",2.0,9.0,3.0,6.0,1.0,"We have been looking forward to stay at this property but have been disappointed by the hotel on many occasions.

Em minhas ultimas 3 estadas, nos ultimos 2 meses, este é o unico hotel onde nao obtenho nenhum tipo de servico adicional por ser membro de Bonvoy. Tentei em diferentes ocasioes, possíveis upgrades ou late check-outs sem sucesso. 

Mesmo entendendo que estes benefícios sao vinculados a sua eventual disponibilidade, o que me incomoda é a falta de boa vontade por parte do staff em nem sequer tentar / averiguar a possibilidade e apenas responder que nao e que estao lotados. 

Como sempre em Argentina, me parece uma visao míope, preferindo atender de forma prioritaria ao turista ocasional, que atualmente vem a Argentina pela diferenca cambiaria, vs atender ao viajante corporativo que vai seguir visitando a Argentina em diferentes momentos do país.

In my last 3 stays, in the last 2 months, this is the only hotel where I do not get any type of additional service for being a Bonvoy member. I have tried on different occasions, possible upgrades or late check-outs without success. Even though I understand that these benefits are linked to their eventual availability, what bothers me is the lack of goodwill on the part of the staff in not even trying / investigating the possibility and just responding that no and that they are full. As always in Argentina, this seems to me to be a short-sighted approach, preferring to prioritize the occasional tourist, who currently comes to Argentina because of the exchange rate difference, versus serving the corporate traveler who will continue to visit Argentina at different times in the country. I will continue to consider Buenos Aires among my alternatives, but for now I will prioritize the Sheraton or another hotel where I am generally treated better.",neutral,-0.30000001192092896,3.700000047683716,negative

One night we felt a lot of noise coming from above our room ( 2122 ) and we had to call the front desk to complaint and they apologize , they were working repairing the pool above us, the work initiated again around 6:00 am, we complained aging and it did stop.

The bathroom shower door is damaged and the main door does not lock properly.

We moved for one free night ( points ) to 603 and here the internet is poor, you have to come to the main door to connect.

Twice I ask for more towels via my BonVoy app and they never brought  them, my wife called for feather pillows and they never arrived  all for room 2123. 

Location wise is excellent , but the whole area has deteriorated .

Looking forward for my next stay in Nov 2023 , perhaps at the Sheraton San Martin or your future location in Puerto Madero.

El hotel esta a la altura.

The hotel is up to par. There are always things to improve, for example I did not take the buffet service for my stay and during the afternoon hours it was difficult to get a waiter to serve us since everyone was in that area. Perhaps the head waiter&#39;s communication could be improved when providing information. I approached him a couple of times during buffet service hours to ask him to send a waiter to take my order in the lobby bar area and his communication was somewhat rough, I understand that there are several people and it is peak service time; But I am also a guest at the hotel and I deserve the same attention and care as the rest of the guests.

El día siguiente cuando hicieron la habitación no habían dejado toallas !! Y dejaron una usada que estaba para cambiar. ( evidentemente usada)
En la mesa de luz “dejaron olvidado” un aromatizador de ambiente ( dispensador). 
Hicimos los reclamos correspondientes. Cuando llevaron las toallas, una de las toallas de rostro tenía una mancha, de tinta, de maquillaje o sangre. Evidentemente el lavado no fue suficiente. …
En la noche, reclamamos el secador de pelo que despedía olor a quemado ya que estaba con los cables al aire. Por lo tanto no lo pudimos usar por el riesgo que eso conlleva.
Al otro día, reclamamos 4 veces el cambio del secador y cada vez que llamábamos a recepción, parecía que no estaban al tanto de lo solicitado.

And they left a used one that needed to be changed. (obviously used). They “forgotten” an air freshener (dispenser) on the nightstand. We made the corresponding complaints. When they brought the towels, one of the face towels had a stain, either ink, makeup or blood. Obviously, the washing was not enough. … At night, we complained about the hair dryer that gave off a burning smell since the wires were exposed. Therefore, we could not use it due to the risk that this entails. The next day, we complained 4 times about the hair dryer being changed and every time we called reception, it seemed that they were not aware of what we had requested.

I used four suite nights to upgrade my room since I would be staying at the hotel for several days and was hoping for a spacious room with a decent view. Within two days of my trip, I received a confirmation that my upgrade request had been accepted for a deluxe city view suite with a sitting area.

We were scheduled to arrive at the hotel after midnight on Friday, November 4 so I contacted the hotel to make them aware of this on Thursday and again on Friday. They confirmed that they made a note of my reservation and that our three rooms would be available when we arrived. 

When we arrived at check-in we were presented paperwork to sign for our rooms and get our keys. I reminded them that I was Platinum elite and my room had been upgraded. They told me room 1626 was the upgraded room. When I went to my room, it was not only small and cramped, it was next to the service area and the elevators. The detached shower head did not work properly and there was water all over the floor after a less than 5 minute shower. The television in my room did not work, I played with the cords but could not get it a signal. The safe also did not work. I requested three times for someone to come fix it.

Later that day, I went to see my two friends’ rooms and both were nearly twice the square footage and had lovely city views. Immediately, I went downstairs with my Spanish-speaking friend to see where the mix up occurred. At the front desk, they told me that nothing else was available. We even asked if they was a standard room, which would have been larger than mine, and they claimed they would try to see what they could do. 

After speaking with several front desk staff during our stay, they never accommodated me as a Platinum, soon to be Titanium, elite member. Instead, I spent four night in a cramped room with a broken television, poor views and had to endure listening to the repeated chiming of the elevators, as well as hearing the housekeeping carts and other staff come in and out of the area next to my room.

Two-three days later I paid another installment to the hotel with the bills I received from the same Cambio place. Ana two-three days later I paid the final installment. That's it!

2022-06-22 16:34:11.000,SERGIO,Member,2.0,"La estadía estuvo bastante alejada de lo que esperabamos recibir.
Desde el comienzo las cosas no salieron bien, llegamos 15:15hs del 18/06 al hotel, cuando el horario de checkin pactado era a las 15hs y la habitación aun no estaba lista, a lo que el personal de recepción nos dijo: ""Esperen en el lobby y utilicen su trago de bienvenida"" situación que conllevó mas de una hora de espera hasta poder tomar la habitación y los servicios del hotel.
La mayor parte del personal del hotel (porque decir todos seria injusto) no es informativa ni cordial con los clientes; nadie nos recibió el equipaje ni nos guió a la habitación, no nos explicaron nunca como utilizar los servicios, siempre tuvimos que preguntar como hacer las cosas. Una de las consultas nos tuvo esperando en el teléfono de la habitación por minutos hasta que nos atendió personal de recepción. 
El SPA deja mucho que desear, las toallas y batas que ofrecen están rotas de lo viejas que son, nunca pudimos obtener las pantuflas para ingresar al spa. El ambiente no se condice con el de un SPA donde uno espera relajarse, es mas bien una piscina de recreación donde hay niños y adultos gritando y zambulléndose en el agua, sin perjuicio de que las indicaciones de la piscina indican lo contrario.
La habitación cuenta con hidromasaje que es solo un lindo adorno, ya que no puede utilizarse según la respuesta del personal para no generar ruidos molestos, cuando es habitual escuchar música de otras habitaciones. A ello debemos adicionar el ruido que generó un evento el domingo por la noche en uno de los salones del hotel. Las aberturas que dan a la calle tienen muy mala aislación acústica e incluso en el caso de nuestra habitación -una de las mas costosas en el piso 21- los burletes viejos dejaban ingresar una ventisca y provocaban silbidos molestos. El empapelado de la pared estaba desgastado y había marcas de malas reparaciones en el techo de la habitación, a uno de los placares le faltaba la manija para abrir la puerta, entre otros detalles. Es dable destacar nuevamente que era la habitación 2121 denominada ""de lujo con vista a la ciudad"".
Para concluir, a la hora del checkout habían cargado a nuestra habitación gastos que no correspondían cuya constatación demoró ampliamente la salida.
Esto no es solo una critica pretenciosa, se trata de un hotel de categoría internacional con una tarifa que resulta ser carísima respecto del servicio que se recibe a cambio. 
Lo único destacable de la atención brindada por vuestro hotel, fue la amabilidad y predisposición del Sr. Gustavo, quien se encontraba trabajando en el restaurante de planta baja y se encargó de servirnos la cena incluida en el paquete contratado y un almuerzo que abonamos debido a la espera causada por la imposibilidad de acceder a la habitación en el horario pactado.",10.0,7.0,5.0,3.0,9.0,Unknown,10.0,Couple,3.0,Excelente,482,6,2022,2022-06,Invierno,6.0,es,"The stay was quite far from what we expected to receive. From the beginning things did not go well, we arrived at the hotel at 3:15 pm on June 18, when the agreed check-in time was at 3 pm and the room was not yet ready, to which the reception staff told us: &quot;Wait in the lobby and use your welcome drink&quot; situation that led to more than an hour of waiting until we could take the room and the hotel services. Most of the hotel staff (because saying all would be unfair) is not informative or friendly with the clients; no one received our luggage or guided us to the room, they never explained to us how to use the services, we always had to ask how to do things. One of the queries had us waiting on the phone in the room for minutes until the reception staff attended to us. The SPA leaves a lot to be desired, the towels and robes they offer are broken from how old they are, we were never able to get the slippers to enter the spa. The atmosphere is not that of a spa where one expects to relax, it is more like a recreational pool where there are children and adults shouting and diving into the water, despite the fact that the pool signs indicate otherwise. The room has a whirlpool, which is just a nice decoration, since it cannot be used according to the staff&#39;s response in order not to generate annoying noises, when it is common to hear music from other rooms. To this we must add the noise generated by an event on Sunday night in one of the hotel&#39;s rooms. The openings that face the street have very poor acoustic insulation and even in the case of our room - one of the most expensive on the 21st floor - the old weather stripping let in a blizzard and caused annoying whistling. The wallpaper on the wall was worn and there were marks of poor repairs on the ceiling of the room, one of the closets was missing the handle to open the door, among other details. It is worth noting again that it was room 2121 called &quot;deluxe with city view&quot;. Finally, at checkout they had charged our room for expenses that were not appropriate, and the verification of which greatly delayed our departure. This is not just a pretentious criticism, this is an international class hotel with a rate that turns out to be very expensive compared to the service received in return. The only thing worth mentioning about the service provided by your hotel was the kindness and willingness of Mr. Gustavo, who was working in the restaurant on the ground floor and was in charge of serving us the dinner included in the package contracted and a lunch that we paid for due to the wait caused by the impossibility of accessing the room at the agreed time.",negative,-0.5,7.599999904632568,negative

El baño tenia el yacuzzi roto, la ducha chica, la puerta no cerraba, se mojo todo el baño y el agua salía horrible, para cualquier lado, la grifería no funcionaba bien.-
Debo decir que una empleada ofreció cambiarme de habitación pero en una estadía de un día eso es difícil, ya que cuando descubrí todos los desperfectos ya era tarde.-
Realmente sentí que me dieron la peor habitación del hotel.-
Todos los empleados me atendieron correctamente, excepto un chico rubio, usaba una escarapela redonda, no recuerdo el nombre, que la verdad me dio la sensación que le molestaba atenderme, por teléfono le pedí un secador de pelo y no me lo enviaron, lo tuve que reclamar personalmente, también le pedí un auto particular e insistía con un taxi, no se que le pasaba.-
La verdad es que una habitación simple en su hotel es demasiado cara para la clase de servicio que dan, he ido a otros 5 estrellas mucho mejores e incluso a 4 estrellas con habitaciones mas lindas.-
Es una pena porque realmente no me dan ganas de volver e hicieron que mi viaje no fue del todo agradable, los elegí por que iba a ver Opera al Teatro Colón, me quedaba cómodo, sólo cruzar la calle, en mi próximo viaje optaré por otros hoteles cercanos.-

1. la ventana del cuarto 2123 está rota, le hace falta una manecilla. 
2. El agua caliente se arruinó a la mitad de la estancia, parecía que era un problema a nivel de todas las habitaciones según lo que me contaban los reparadores que trataron de ayudarme (fueron más de 3)
3. Por causa de que la ventana no cerraba completamente, el día del diluvio, el cuarto se inundó bastante y no me ofrecieron otra habitación. La lluvia fue del 26 al 27 de abril. Y hay récord de la llamada que tuve que hacer a las 3 am del 27 para que vinieran a ayudarme a limpiar la habitación.
4.  Por esa misma ventana rota y lluvia supongo que se infiltró un bicho que me causó muchas visitas al hospital y hasta una noche que tuvieron que llegar los doctores a la habitación a inyectarme (también hay récord de la llamada a los paramédicos el 28 de abril por la noche, Justo un día después de la tormenta e inundación). Los doctores de guardia del hospital británico dijeron que eso solo podía ser un bicho, y probablemente que estaba en la cama donde yo dormía ya que la infección empezó a las 3 am del jueves 28 de abril. Un total de más de 500 USD pagados en medicinas, inyecciones y doctores, que el hotel no se dignó en compensar de ninguna manera. Pero eso si.. si me cobraron el café de la habitación. 
5. Un puerto usb para cargar los teléfonos se quemó una noche donde se llenó de humo mi habitación (el 6 de mayo de 2022, donde también hay récord de la llamada de las 10 pm). 
7. Por último, llevo un mes pidiendo que me acrediten mis noches y puntos a mi cuenta de    Bonvoy pero aún no lo hacen. Fueron 24 noches del 16 de abril al 10 de mayo de 2022, y con la promoción de doble noche deberían de haber sido más de 30 noches y más de 2000 puntos extra que aún no recibo.

The hot water was ruined halfway through the stay, it seemed like it was a problem at the level of all the rooms according to what the repairmen who tried to help me told me (there were more than 3) 3. Because the window did not close completely, the day of the flood, the room flooded quite a bit and they did not offer me another room. The rain was from April 26 to 27. And there is a record of the call I had to make at 3 am on the 27th to get them to come help me clean the room. 4. Because of that same broken window and rain, I suppose a bug infiltrated, which caused me many visits to the hospital and even one night when the doctors had to come to the room to inject me (there is also a record of the call to the paramedics on April 28 at night, just one day after the storm and flood). The doctors on duty at the British hospital said that it could only be a bug, and probably that it was in the bed where I slept since the infection started at 3 am on Thursday, April 28. A total of more than 500 USD paid for medicines, injections and doctors, which the hotel did not deign to compensate in any way. But yes... they did charge me for the coffee in the room. 5. A USB port to charge the phones burned one night when my room was filled with smoke (on May 6, 2022, where there is also a record of the 10 pm call). 7. Finally, I have been asking for a month to have my nights and points credited to my Bonvoy account but they still haven&#39;t done it. It was 24 nights from April 16 to May 10, 2022, and with the double night promotion it should have been more than 30 nights and more than 2000 extra points that I have not yet received.

Las instalaciones, excelentes. Hay pequeñas cosas que deberían contar con un grado de detalle, que realce el tipo de hotel. Por ejemplo, en el baño de mi habitación, había manchas de pintura blanca en los azulejos. La tapa del inodoro no tenía todas las gomas que hacen de apoyo. Parte del zócalo de madera del marco de la puerta del baño, estaba podrido. La luz del placard, está prendida constantemente. Las luces solamente se apagan de la llave que está en la puerta. Si uno se acuesta, se tiene que levantar. Un velador, la lámpara que tenía, era prácticamente una vela porque no iluminaba nada. Para acceder al baño del entrepiso, desde el comedor de PB hay que hacer un curso (y más de noche) porque no se ven bien dónde se encuentran... Son pequeñas cosas que vi, de un molesto que quiere la excelencia, para un hotel de estas características. No obstante lo indicado, siempre pensé, viéndolo de afuera, que no tenía el nivel que tiene. Otra cosa, entiendo que no es la función del hotel, brindar estacionamiento, pero teniendo en cuenta que estaba prácticamente vacío (o por lo menos con poca gente), el costo es alto.

I didn&#39;t realize when I made the reservation that it included breakfast (it was something that was obvious that the rate included it). The facilities were excellent. There are small things that should be given a level of detail, which would enhance the type of hotel. For example, in the bathroom of my room, there were white paint stains on the tiles. The toilet lid did not have all the rubber that supports it. Part of the wooden baseboard of the bathroom door frame was rotten. The closet light is constantly on. The lights only turn off with the key that is in the door. If you go to bed, you have to get up. A nightstand, the lamp that it had, was practically a candle because it did not illuminate anything. To access the bathroom on the mezzanine, from the dining room on the ground floor, you have to take a course (and more so at night) because you cannot see well where they are... These are small things that I saw, from an annoying person who wants excellence, for a hotel of these characteristics. Despite what I have said, I always thought, looking at it from the outside, that it was not as good as it is. Another thing, I understand that it is not the hotel&#39;s function to provide parking, but taking into account that it was practically empty (or at least with few people), the cost is high.

Segundo, que teniendo una tina de hidromasaje, este no funcione, más aún cuando la piscina del hotel, la tienen en mantenimiento en PLENO VERANO y con 37 grados de temperatura. Los amenities de muy mala calidad y poca cantidad (hay que estar pidiendo todos los días para poder ducharse). La habitación no cuenta con secador de pelo ni plancha, no es posible que haya que pedirlo, y te envíen un aparato que se desarma solo. Por último, encuentro de muy mal criterio cobrar por hacer llamadas locales a números públicos, eso ya raya en la avaricia. La verdad esperaba MUCHO más de este hotel. No creo que vuelva a repetir mi estadía.",10.0,4.0,9.0,3.0,5.0,Unknown,10.0,Family,2.625,Excelente,138,1,2022,2022-01,Verano,5.25,es,"First and foremost, I think it is TERRIBLE that the bathroom in a hotel of such magnitude does not have any type of ventilation. Second, that even though it has a whirlpool tub, it does not work, even more so when the hotel pool is being maintained in the MIDDLE OF SUMMER and with temperatures of 37 degrees. The amenities are of very poor quality and in short supply (you have to ask for them every day to be able to shower). The room does not have a hair dryer or iron, it is not possible that you have to ask for them, and they send you a device that falls apart by itself. Lastly, I find it very bad judgment to charge for making local calls to public numbers, that is bordering on greed. The truth is that I expected MUCH more from this hotel. I don&#39;t think I will repeat my stay.",negative,-0.699999988079071,5.199999809265137,negative
